# JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Description

 The main goal is to make a password generator which contain the function that will ask user the length, options of the password(such as upper caracters. lower, number and special symbols), and result will come out with the preference which user required.
 The most diffcult part will be the array part that I'm not very familiar with, and either hard to get the idea of the math method.
 Everything needs to be make the structure in the beginning. For example, I should map the structure that if user press the button then the page windows will ask the question one by one and we should generage the password through the infomation that we got from user depends on client's requirement.
